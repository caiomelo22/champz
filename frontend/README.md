## Setup
To run the project, just create a `.env` file with the following variables. They represent your API base url, and the static directory of your API where your static images are going to be mirrored as a volume.

```
VUE_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/"
VUE_APP_MEDIA_URL="http://localhost:8000/static/"
```
